Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of corrosion control.
