Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
