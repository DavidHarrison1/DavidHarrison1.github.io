<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
