<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>The drains in the average house get consistent usage. Hair, food scraps, soap scum, and other debris can slowly build up gradually.

Regeneration immediately begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
