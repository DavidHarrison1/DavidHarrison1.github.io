<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
