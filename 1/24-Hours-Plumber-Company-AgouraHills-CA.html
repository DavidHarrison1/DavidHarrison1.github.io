<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
