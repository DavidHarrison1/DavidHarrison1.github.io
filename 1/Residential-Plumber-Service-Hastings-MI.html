That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water home appliances? This is a good sign that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be changed. Remember that if the rust-colored water just features warm water, the cause could be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
