<p>Typically, there are tank hot water heater that utilize either natural gas or electrical energy for their fuel.

When either temperature level or pressure exceeds preset levels, they likewise include a temperature and pressure-release valve that opens. We provide gas water heater service, in addition to electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>

In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on wet or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
