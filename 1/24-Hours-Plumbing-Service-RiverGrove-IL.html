On this page are various Hyperlinks to help you in doing business with the City of Buffalo's Department of License and Inspection Services.</p>
<p>The system has actually returned to a no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the method. This allows pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
