These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable television injury around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, remove the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged before proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the manage in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the exact same time.
