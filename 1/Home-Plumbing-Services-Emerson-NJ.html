<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet must be changed. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>

Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>

If the hot water heater has a drain valve, we'll drain and flush it to keep it running at peak performance. Draining pipes a water heater extend its life.</p>
