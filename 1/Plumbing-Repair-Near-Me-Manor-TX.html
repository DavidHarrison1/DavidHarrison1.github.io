Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
