<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Therefore, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
