<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>
