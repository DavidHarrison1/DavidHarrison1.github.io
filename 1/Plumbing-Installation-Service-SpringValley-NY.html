It's prevalent for a toilet to have worn out parts at some point which triggers the toilet to run. What they imply is the toilet will not stop running when someone says a toilet is running. This is normally due to worn out flapper valve, however a few other common problems are the fill valve and the overflow tube.</p>

Inspections called in on work not completed, not properly installed, or on an unattainable property will need re-inspection. It is the permit holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
