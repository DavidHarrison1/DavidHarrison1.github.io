<h3>How to Save Water With Leak Detection Awareness in Wayne PA</h3>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clean out tough drain blockages and leave them working fresh once again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Overall expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which typically averages 30'.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
