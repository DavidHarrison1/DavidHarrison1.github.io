<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
