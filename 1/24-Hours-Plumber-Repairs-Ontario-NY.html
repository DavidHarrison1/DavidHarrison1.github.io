<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted life-span of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a solidifying lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is produced inside the broken one.</p>

Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
