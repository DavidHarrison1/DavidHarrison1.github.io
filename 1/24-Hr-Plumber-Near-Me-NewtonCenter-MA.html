<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber NewtonCenter MA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
