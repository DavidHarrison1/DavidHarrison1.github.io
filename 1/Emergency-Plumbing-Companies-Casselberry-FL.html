<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and full bathroom renovating at extremely competitive rates. You can unwind and use your gas piping without any concern when we manage your gas or propane pipe installation and gas pipe repair. While water overuse is an issue for your wallet, it's likewise a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming an issue in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not hold on to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>
