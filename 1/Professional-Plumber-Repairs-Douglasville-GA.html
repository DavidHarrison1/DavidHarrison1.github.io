<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
