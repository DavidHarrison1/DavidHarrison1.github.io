<p>Electric hot water heater do have a couple of downsides however that deserve mentioning. Firstly, electricity is not as inexpensive as gas. Some energy companies charge greater rates for electrical power during peak durations such as very early in the early morning and at night. Using your heater during these peak durations can increase your power bills. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another drawback of an electric water heater is that they can be costly to install, particularly when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that makes use of the point-of-use hot water heater; these appliances will supply warm water constantly for the period you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work just if there are power problems or if the hot water heater is faulty. In essence, it heats the water on demand with simply the amount you need, therefore taking away the loss incurred with the use of tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
