<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
