<p>Similar to other construction employees, work of pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers is sensitive to variations in the economy.

<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>In many cases, a lack of hot water is caused by a faulty breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be cracked if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is normally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and need to be instantly addressed by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
