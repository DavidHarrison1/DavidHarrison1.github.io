<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to providing an extensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures satisfy and surpass the standards developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Recent changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing components, valves, pipes, and fittings that are straight planned for human water usage are required to be made with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material.

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
