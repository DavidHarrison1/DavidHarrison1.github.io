In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
