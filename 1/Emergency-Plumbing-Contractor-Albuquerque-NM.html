<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually degraded in its efficiency below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if essential, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
