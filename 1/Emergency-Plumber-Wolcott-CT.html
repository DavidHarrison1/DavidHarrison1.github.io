<p>As explained earlier in the short article, carbon monoxide is completely odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the proper places. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>

<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
