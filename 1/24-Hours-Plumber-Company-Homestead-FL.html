<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
