Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
