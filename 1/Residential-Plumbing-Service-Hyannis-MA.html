<p>And so, we see the transition from big transportation pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to whole cities to big circulation pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or large centers, to medium distribution pipelines and finally to small service pipelines. Each stage in the supply of water and circulation system needs to deal with differing circulation rates, circulation speeds and pressure heads, together with various levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or contaminant seepage and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>

RV = The Relief Valve operates by noticing the pressure distinction across the # 1 Check Valve. The Relief Valve must start to open before the pressure difference falls below 2.0 psi. Your plumbing contractor need to finish a repiping job with some mix of the above pipes.</p>
<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally release percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
