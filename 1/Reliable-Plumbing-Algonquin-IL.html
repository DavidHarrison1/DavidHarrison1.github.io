<p>Backflow threatens due to the fact that it can pollute the general public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals. In 2010, for example, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered nausea and other symptoms after a contractor dealing with the HEATING AND COOLING system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners sell nowadays. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Company then usually blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was developed prior to the 1970s or hasn't been redesigned, you will probably have old pipes that need replacing.</p>

It can cause water to build all the way up your drains and develop a leak someplace along the way if the P-trap under you sink is clogged.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
