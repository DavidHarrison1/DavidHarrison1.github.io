<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
