<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other communities and organizations, has actually discovered the very best method to avoid these discolorations from happening is by decreasing the variety of times your water softener regenerates. "Regenerating" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "tired" or full. However, lots of water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be remedied by merely resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
