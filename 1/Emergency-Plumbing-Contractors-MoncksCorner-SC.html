<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only initial factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or apartment board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file plans with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent out. Violators will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to civil and criminal actions and proceedings, as well as the termination of water service to the building.</p>
