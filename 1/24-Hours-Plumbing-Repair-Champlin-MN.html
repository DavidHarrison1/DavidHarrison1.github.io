<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
