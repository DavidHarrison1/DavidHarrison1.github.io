Recent Review: Howard, the Job Manager, has actually constantly been useful and useful concerning all our issues. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair quickly. It is always an enjoyment to deal with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He had the ability to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always enjoyable, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Step 6: To connect the drain, insert the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then connect the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by aligning the 3 tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then link the dishwasher drain. Make certain the discharge pipe is lined up effectively and connect your drains-- use a T-pipe before your P-trap.</p>
