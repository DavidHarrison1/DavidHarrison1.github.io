<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Gretna NE</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
