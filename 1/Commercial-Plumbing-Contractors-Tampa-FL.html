<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
