<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in multiple drains at once in your home, then that normally indicates that your main sewer line is backing up. This can happen in several areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine.

Damaged sewer lines can result in bathrooms flooded with sewage, busted pipes, and costly repairs.</p>
