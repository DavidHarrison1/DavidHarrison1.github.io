<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply hard to identify, they're also capable of triggering some severe damage. Pinhole leakages, for example, are so small that they just launch a couple of droplets at a time. That's far too small to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the designated time period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be used in the future.</p>
