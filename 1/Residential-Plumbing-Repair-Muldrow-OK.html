<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Muldrow OK</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
