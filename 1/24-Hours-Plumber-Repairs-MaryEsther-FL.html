<p>Borax beings in the exact same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it comes with the same drawbacks i.e. skin inflammation and accumulation. If either of these disadvantages are unacceptable to you - you'll want to find what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Turn on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and slide the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>
