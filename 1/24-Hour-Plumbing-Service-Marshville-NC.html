<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Marshville NC</h3>
<p>We genuinely care about our consumers and the services that we provide. As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time between charging cycles depends upon the firmness of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>
<p>To figure out if your house is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the house near the water heater. Your main shut off is connected to completion of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
