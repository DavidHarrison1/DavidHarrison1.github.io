Extended service warranty: Most disposals include at least a 1-year guarantee, however if you buy one with a life time warranty (15+ years), it will most likely be more pricey. While there's not a specific timetable as to when you should repipe your house, you should definitely look into repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older house built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new system in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will result in decapitation, it may terrify a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
