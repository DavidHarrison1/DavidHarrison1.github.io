<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on an extremely low circulation or static circulation condition may trigger annoyance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
