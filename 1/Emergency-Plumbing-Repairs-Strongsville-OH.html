That's not quite salt, however for those on a strict sodium-free diet plan it may be too much. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's parts, normally the flapper. There may also be a problem with the chain attached to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>

This responsive style permits the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
