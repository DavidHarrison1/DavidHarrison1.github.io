A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
