We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
