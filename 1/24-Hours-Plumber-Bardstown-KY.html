<p>When choosing the correct system protection there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be taken a look at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system.

Fire defense system are created to match the danger that exists in the places they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be really different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and installed to meet that particular danger or need. An airplane garage will need a very various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
