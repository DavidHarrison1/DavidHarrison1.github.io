A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.

More recent units utilize computerized sensing units that monitor bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate when required.
