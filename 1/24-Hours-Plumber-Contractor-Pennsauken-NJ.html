<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions.

<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up corrosion Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these elements, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the community system, it's still clever to bring in the professionals to restrict the damage to your house.</p>

Location a bucket beneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
