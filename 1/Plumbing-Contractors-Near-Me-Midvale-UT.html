<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical substance that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. However, if they remain in one location for long, as they might in a hot water heater, the buildup might still take place.</p>
