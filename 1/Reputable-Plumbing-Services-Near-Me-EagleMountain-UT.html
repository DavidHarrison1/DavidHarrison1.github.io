<p>Woodbury, along with many other neighborhoods and organizations, has actually found the very best method to avoid these discolorations from taking place is by decreasing the variety of times your water softener restores. "Restoring" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. Nevertheless, numerous water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium truly isn't complete. This can be fixed by merely resetting your water softener to eliminate less hardness or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
