<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
