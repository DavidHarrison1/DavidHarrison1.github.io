<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Goodyear AZ</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last thirty years.

Today, the majority of quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
