<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work.

Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and rust.
