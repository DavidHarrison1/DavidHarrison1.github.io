A common protective device called a backflow preventer (BFP) can be set up within the plumbing system to effectively shut-off the house or company from the street sewer system throughout sewage back-ups.</p>
<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>

For blockages that occur further down the pipe, utilize a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable television auger, remove the horizontal P-trap beneath the sink, ensuring it is not clogged before proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable television at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and push the auger forward at the exact same time. Repeat the process, pulling out an additional 18 inches up until you break through the obstruction. Sometimes loose debris will settle into a new obstruction. Follow with a plunger, if required.</p>
<p>Metal alloys are susceptible to an electro-chemical condition called corrosion. Corrosion can actually eat a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or modify the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. The effect of corrosion on a metal alloy need to be examined to determine if the part is usable or must be replaced.</p>
