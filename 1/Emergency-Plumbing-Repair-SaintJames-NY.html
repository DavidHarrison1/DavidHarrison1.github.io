<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services SaintJames NY</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
