For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
