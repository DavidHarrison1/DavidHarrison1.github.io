Recurring leakages and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.

<p>A house's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. For the most part, the property owner is responsible for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
