<p>Every hot water heater we install has been tested under the most extreme water temperatures and was built to last a very long time. When your existing water heater begins failing, a brand-new installation may cost money up front, however it can save you hundreds or even countless dollars in the long run.

Our local plumbing contractors are happy to work with you to come up with the ideal water heater system for your home or service.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and corrodes internally. When drawing water from galvanized pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other contaminants flow into your drinking water. These contaminants also clog the pipe internally stopping the circulation of water to components. After we evaluate the drains and water system lines and clean up the area, your new sink will be prepared to use! When you need sink installation or sink repairs or any kind of commercial or residential plumbing service in Northern Virginia, contact our Leesburg Sink Repair Professionals at Kiddco Plumbing.</p>
