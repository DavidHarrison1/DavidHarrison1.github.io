<p>When the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage turned off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
