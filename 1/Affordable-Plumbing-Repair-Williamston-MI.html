<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.

With time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon or so helps get rid of the sediment.
