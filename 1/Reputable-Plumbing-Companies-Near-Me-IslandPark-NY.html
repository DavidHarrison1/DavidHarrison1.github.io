<p>If you choose to try this task yourself, be prepared to keep precise track of about a lots tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none drop the drain).

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation direction within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. If this is the case, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You may need to check out using a high pressure water supply to eliminate the clog.
