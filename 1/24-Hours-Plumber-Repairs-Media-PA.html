<p>If your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it changed. An excellent rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: since the life expectancy of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining a gallon or two assists get rid of the sediment. If you identify a leak and choose a patching task rather of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
