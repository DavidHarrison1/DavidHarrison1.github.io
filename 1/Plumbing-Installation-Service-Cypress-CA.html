As soon as this occurs it will cause a decline in the water pressure and also dramatically decreases the life-span of all household appliances. Water leakages: If you see a leak in your pipes, there might be other leakages you are uninformed of. Leaks are a sure sign that your pipes are worn and old and need to be replaced. Rather than needing to constantly repair them, the best choice. is to replace them.</p>
<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you have actually never done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely originating from the within your water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you most likely have rusted piping.</p>
