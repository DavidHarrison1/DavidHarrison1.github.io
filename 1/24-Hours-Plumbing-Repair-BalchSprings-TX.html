<p>Everyday use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also happen if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing.
