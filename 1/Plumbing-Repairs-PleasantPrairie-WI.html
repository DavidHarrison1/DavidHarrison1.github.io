We also needed to replace a bathroom and a water heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We made the decision to stay with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter rates were absolutely on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
