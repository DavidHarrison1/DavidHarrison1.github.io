I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
