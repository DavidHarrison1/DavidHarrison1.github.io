<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
