We supply gas hot water heater service, along with electrical hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>

<p>Porcelain and stainless steel sinks can last anywhere from 15 to 30 years, with porcelain sinks long lasting thirty years or longer. Porcelain sinks with cast-iron cores can last the longest, and lots of porcelain sinks can be refinished multiple times. Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair changes to the gas piping system.</p>
<p>Use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink if there's an existing disposal. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of houses in my area being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't identified soon.</p>
