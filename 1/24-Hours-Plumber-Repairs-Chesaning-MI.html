<p>When deciding on the proper system defense there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be created and installed to fulfill that specific hazard or need. An aircraft garage will need an extremely various fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would likewise vary significantly.</p>
