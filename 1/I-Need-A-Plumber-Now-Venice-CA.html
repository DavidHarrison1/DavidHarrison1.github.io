<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Venice CA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
