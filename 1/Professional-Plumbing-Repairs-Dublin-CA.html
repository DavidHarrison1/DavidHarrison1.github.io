<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
