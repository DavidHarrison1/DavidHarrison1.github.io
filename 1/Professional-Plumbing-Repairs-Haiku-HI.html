<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
