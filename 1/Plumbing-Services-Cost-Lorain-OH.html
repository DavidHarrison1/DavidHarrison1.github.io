These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
