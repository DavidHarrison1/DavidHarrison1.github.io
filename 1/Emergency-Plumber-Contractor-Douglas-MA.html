<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the exterior.

For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
