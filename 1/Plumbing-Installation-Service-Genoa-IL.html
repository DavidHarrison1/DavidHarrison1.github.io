<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
