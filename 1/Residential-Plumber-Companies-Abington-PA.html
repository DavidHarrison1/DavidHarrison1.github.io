<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
