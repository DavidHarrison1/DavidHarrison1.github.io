<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is made up of numerous mechanical parts which, with time, undergo wear and tear and might need to be changed. Some homeowners have actually taken it upon themselves to figure out how to replace these parts but lots of do not understand how to do it or can not do it well. This is where Matt's Plumbing would enter into play. When in doubt, constantly give us a call and we will fix any of your plumbing problems with the appropriate tools and years of expertise.

<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
