When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental regulations. Local building codes for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon prior to it can happen, preventing infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to avoid backflow range from the reasonably basic to the very sophisticated and complex.</p>
