<p>Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is one of the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can only secure against back siphonage.</p>
