<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, figuring out. An authorization is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
