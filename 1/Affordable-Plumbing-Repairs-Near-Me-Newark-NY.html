<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can attain this.</p>
