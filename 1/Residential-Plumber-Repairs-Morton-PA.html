<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
