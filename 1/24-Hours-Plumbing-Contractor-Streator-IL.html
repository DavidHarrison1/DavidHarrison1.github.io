<p>Woodbury, along with many other neighborhoods and organizations, has discovered the very best method to avoid these stains from occurring is by reducing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regrowing" describes the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or complete. However, many water softeners restore frequently, when the filter medium truly isn't complete. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer in between regrowth cycles.</p>
