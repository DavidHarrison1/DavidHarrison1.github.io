Once the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>

Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
