<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Williamsburg VA?</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some concerns will demand total water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its regular life-span (typically anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a major leak or substantial rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>
