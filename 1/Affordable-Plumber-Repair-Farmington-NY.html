<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Often the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and ecological policies. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical gadgets installed to prevent backflow range from the reasonably easy to the complicated and really sophisticated.</p>
