And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness however, making sure your trip lever is working well can conserve you the inconvenience of those small day-to-day hassles - that many people just live with and never ever understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to mention the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>
