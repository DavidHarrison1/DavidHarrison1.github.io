<p>Obvious odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business place, provide us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will frequently need to be changed rather than fixed. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or emitting foul odors.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the factor you can feel the distinction on your skin is. This leads to the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term hardness" came from ... it's tough to clean in.</p>
