<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

Many plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
