<p>Obvious odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or service place, provide us a call. That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has failed, it will typically need to be changed rather than fixed. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty smells.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leakages. We find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
