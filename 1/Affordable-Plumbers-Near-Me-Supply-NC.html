<p>Because the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to become layered within, New homes constructed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to corrosive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a period of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If everything is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and for that reason the total costs. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
