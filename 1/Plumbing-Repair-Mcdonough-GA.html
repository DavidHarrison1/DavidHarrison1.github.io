<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>You'll need a special disposal if you home uses a septic tank and drain field.

Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
