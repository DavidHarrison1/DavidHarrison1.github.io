<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Alexandria VA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
