<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has area to hang on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions.

<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just removes firmness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>The system has actually returned to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris in between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the method. This allows pressure to match between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
