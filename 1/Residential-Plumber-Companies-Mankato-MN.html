Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the regular instructions from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Decreased Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular direction.</p>
