<h3>Clogged Kitchen Sink in Fairburn Georgia</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
