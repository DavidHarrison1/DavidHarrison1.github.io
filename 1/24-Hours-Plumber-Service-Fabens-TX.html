For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally salt. The result is water that's been effectively softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>

That slow, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts.
