<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in LaGrange IL</h3>
<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components.

By having the anode rod checked frequently and changed as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
