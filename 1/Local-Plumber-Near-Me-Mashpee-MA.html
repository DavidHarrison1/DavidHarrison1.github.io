<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the hardness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
