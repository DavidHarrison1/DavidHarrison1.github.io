<p>Difficult water causes a greater risk of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is minimized. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and likewise fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
<p>At least once every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps get rid of the sediment. If you spot a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
