<p>How to get a plumbing contractor's license involves a few additional steps to reach your end goal - to become a legal contractor.

Each state has its own rules and guidelines when getting a contractor's license, see this article for more extensive info.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping products to achieve the same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire protection system supplied by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is also needed. If you have children, remind them to avoid holding on any visible pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter. Holding on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, releasing gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily accessible in an emergency.</p>
