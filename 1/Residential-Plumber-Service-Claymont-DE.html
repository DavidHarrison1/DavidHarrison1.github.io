It permits you to run water for your meals and drain your tub by merely removing the plug. An efficient piping system is critical to your house. At Hall's Plumbing, we work with Forest, CA property owners whenever they need repiping service or pipe repair.</p>
<p>Inspect the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely originating from the inside of your hot water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have worn away piping.</p>
