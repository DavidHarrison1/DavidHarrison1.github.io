<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will test your water to figure out the best water treatment for your home.

<p>Push the tip of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap until you break out the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the system upside down and shake it out).

We have total confidence that we can manage any type of repair you toss at us.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
