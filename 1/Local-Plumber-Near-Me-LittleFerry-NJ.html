<p>The majority of softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to offer some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's smart to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
