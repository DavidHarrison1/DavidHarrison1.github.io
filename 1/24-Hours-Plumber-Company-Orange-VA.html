<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Really frequently the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply insert a long, sturdy, wooden deal with (a broom handle will be sufficient) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force lowering, turn clockwise up until you feel it turn freely. It may be required to reset the disposal. Locate the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. If the clog persists, use any kind of drain cleaner to free it.</p>
