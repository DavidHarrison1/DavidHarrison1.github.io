<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
