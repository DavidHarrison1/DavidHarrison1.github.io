<p>This is among the main and very first concerns that you need to ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house.

If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to examine your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was developed decades before that, opportunities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at ideal rates.</p>

When the pressure drops for some factor such as may occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention approach used. The best and best type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
