<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, identifying. A license is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drainpipe or drywell.</p>
