When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which assists use extra pressure to the clog. For clogs that happen further down the pipe, use a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable wound around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable television auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, ensuring it is not clogged prior to continuing. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the same time.
