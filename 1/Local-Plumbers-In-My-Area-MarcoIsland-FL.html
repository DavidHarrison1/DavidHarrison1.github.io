<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in MarcoIsland FL</h3>

For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of rust control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
