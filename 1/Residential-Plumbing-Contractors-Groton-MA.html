<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Groton MA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters: These economical and environmentally friendly heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They need no electrical energy or gas and can lower your expenses by an estimated 14 to 18%. A water heater installation is not the repair on which to develop your plumbing skills if you're relatively inexperienced. So save yourself some serious problem by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of products used to build a waste disposal unit system: aluminum and stainless steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has a typical cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, particularly on older homes, so you'll wish to employ someone who will trace the problem at its source.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
