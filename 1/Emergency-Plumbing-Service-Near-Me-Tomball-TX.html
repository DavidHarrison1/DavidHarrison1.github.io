Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of damaging impurities.

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
