<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
