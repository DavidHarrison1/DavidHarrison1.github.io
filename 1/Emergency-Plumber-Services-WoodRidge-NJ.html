<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes.

We discover that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and much better long-term service if you do have regular leakages.</p>
