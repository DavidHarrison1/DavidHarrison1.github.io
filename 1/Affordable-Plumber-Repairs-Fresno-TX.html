When figuring out the hardness of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is thought about very tough water, leaving indicators like spotty glasses and soap scum that is beside impossible to get rid of. With well water, these symptoms may likewise be coupled with iron stains and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.

The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>
