<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has area to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As hard water passes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet.
