Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

However, it includes a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a fairly little cylindrical device set up under the kitchen drain.
