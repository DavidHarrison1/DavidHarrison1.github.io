The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage only for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
