<p>There are a couple of various elements to take into consideration if you are deciding between fixing and changing. Initially, you need to consider the length of time you have had your existing system. A repair is more cost efficient if your water heater is under 5 years. You should also opt for repairs if the issue is small, such as a brand-new filament installation.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can posture problems.</p>
