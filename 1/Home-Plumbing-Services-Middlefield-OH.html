<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, however it is also really uncommon. They were produced so as to offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. As for the risk, this device covers dangerous as well as non-hazardous situations. But just as with the AVB it can not handle back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system offering the cosmetics water, backpressure is developed. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential contaminants can then go into the safe and clean water system. The very best method to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year.
