Patching is typically sufficient for small leaks and one-off problems. However, if you experience any of the following problems in your house, you need to think about repiping.</p>
<p>New homes constructed with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have actually not had a chance to become coated within. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new house for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are developed with PEX and not copper.</p>
