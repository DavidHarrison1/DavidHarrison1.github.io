A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.
