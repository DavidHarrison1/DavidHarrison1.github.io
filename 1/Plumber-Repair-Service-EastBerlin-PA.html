<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
