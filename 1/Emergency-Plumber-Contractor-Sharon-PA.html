<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly.

If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-lasting option.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Expenses to prepare the worksite for Kitchen Sink Drain Repair, consisting of expenses to protect existing structure( s), elements, surfaces and materials.

Or it can be a much simpler task where a single piece of pipe is switched out with a new one.</p>
