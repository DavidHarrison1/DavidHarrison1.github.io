<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Carmichael CA</h3>

Extended guarantee: Most disposals include at least a 1-year guarantee, however if you purchase one with a lifetime guarantee (15+ years), it will probably be more costly. While there's not an exact schedule as to when you need to repipe your home, you should definitely look into repiping if they haven't been performed in 50 years or more-- especially if you live in an older home constructed closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
