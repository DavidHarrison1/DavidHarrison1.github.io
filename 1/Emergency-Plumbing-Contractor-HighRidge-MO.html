<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems utilizing non-potable piping products to attain the same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire defense system supplied by a safe and clean water supply, increased security is likewise needed.
