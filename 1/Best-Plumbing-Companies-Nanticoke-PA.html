Tank water heaters are typically discovered in most houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to provide warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons for drain line obstructions in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will generally advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the severity of the scenario.
