<p>When choosing the correct system security there are numerous considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the threat that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to meet that particular hazard or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary considerably.</p>
