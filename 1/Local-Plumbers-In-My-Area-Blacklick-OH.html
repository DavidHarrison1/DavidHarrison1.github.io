Local plumber priced quote cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I checked around. Under the sink, put a pail or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a pipe wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and prevent it from working. This is referred to as fouling.
