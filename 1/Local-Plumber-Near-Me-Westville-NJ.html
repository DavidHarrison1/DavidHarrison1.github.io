Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the issue.
