<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Argyle TX</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
