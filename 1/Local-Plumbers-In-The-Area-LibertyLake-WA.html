At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & A/c we provide 24-hour emergency support for circumstances like burst pipes caused by blockages. Detach the garbage disposal, if you're saving it. How the disposal is connected to the sink differs based on brand name and type. If you need assistance, refer to your product directions or contact the producer. The disposal will normally be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
