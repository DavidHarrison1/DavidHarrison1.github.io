<p>Obvious odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your home or business area, offer us a call.

If your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty odors, you'll understand this.</p>

There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
