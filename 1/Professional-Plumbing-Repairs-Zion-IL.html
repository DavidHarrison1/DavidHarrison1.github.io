<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Zion IL</h3>
<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be gotten rid of and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to utilize and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black).

Make sure you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>

<p>Your disposer might come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the standard plumber's putty as laid out below.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
