<p>You reside in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
