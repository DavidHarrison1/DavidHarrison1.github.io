<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Mansfield MA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your hot water, then check the status of your water heater's anode rod. You might need a professional to do this if you've never ever done this on your own.
