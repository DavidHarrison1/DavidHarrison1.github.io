<p>Inside the house, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leaks. Inspect underneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I inspected around. Under the sink, place a pail or pan below the waste pipe, then utilize locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
