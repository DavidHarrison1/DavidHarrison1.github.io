Your kitchen might end up being clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that trigger the obstruction. Your toilet may become stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you might have a house-wide backup brought on by sewage coming back up through the pipes.</p>
<p>If you choose to try this task yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a dozen small parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them drop the drain). There are various faucet designs, so you may not have the ability to inform what to replace till you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or work with a plumber, this would be a great time to think of whether you wish to update the faucet with a new design.</p>
