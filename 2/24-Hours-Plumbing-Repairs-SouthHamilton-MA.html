A water softener addresses one of the most common and destructive water problems: tough water.  Tough water ruined the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically reduces the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice devices.
