<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are especially prone to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being coated within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Bartlett IL?</h3>
<p>Checking the age, condition, and water lines to the water heater can help plumbers comprehend lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leaks. It can likely last beyond its standard service warranty if the water heater has actually been kept with yearly flush service. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, need a backflow prevention device.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>

Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
