<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
