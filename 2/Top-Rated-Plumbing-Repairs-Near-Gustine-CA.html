<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
