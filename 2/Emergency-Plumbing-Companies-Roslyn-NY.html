<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on speedy service, precise troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your business never has to suffer from downtime. You can rely on the professionals at US Water Systems to offer you with a real water softener, you will love, not some salt-free imaginary one that doesn't soften the water. With a water softener from US Water Systems, you will use up to 75% less soap, conserve approximately 30% on water heating expenses while securing your plumbing and devices. It will make your clothes whiter and brighter, and of course, it makes cleaning a breeze. You get rid of areas, streaks and scum on showers and components too, and among the very best parts is that you have spot-free dishes and flatware.</p>
<p>Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
