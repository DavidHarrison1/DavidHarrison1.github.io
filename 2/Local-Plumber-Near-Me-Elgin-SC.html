However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Most house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, in addition to inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
