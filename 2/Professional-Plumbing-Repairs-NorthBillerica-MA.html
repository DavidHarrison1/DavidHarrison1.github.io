<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
