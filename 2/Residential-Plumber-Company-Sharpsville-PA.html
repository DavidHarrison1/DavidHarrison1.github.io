<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
