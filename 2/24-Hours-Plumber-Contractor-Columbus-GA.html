<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Columbus GA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
