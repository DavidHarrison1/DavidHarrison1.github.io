Large amounts of food can quickly overwhelm the system and trigger an extensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets many phone calls requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>

<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink.

Utilizing his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
