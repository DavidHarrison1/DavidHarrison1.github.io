<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller design that ran on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes.

Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
