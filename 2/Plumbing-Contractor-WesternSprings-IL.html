<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

No, it is not a regular occurrence, but it does occur more frequently than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it takes place at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
