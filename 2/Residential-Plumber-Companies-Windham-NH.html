<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
