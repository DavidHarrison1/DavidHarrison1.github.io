<p>Unbreakable Blockages: Professional support is the very best solution, if you find yourself presented with a particularly stubborn clog. You may end up doing more harm than excellent if you continue to combat with it, which can develop irreversible problems. Sewage back-flow is another major issue if you do not have an expert look into your clog circumstance.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
