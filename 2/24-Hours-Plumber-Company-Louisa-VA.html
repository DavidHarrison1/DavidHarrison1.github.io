<p>Therefore, we see the transition from big transport pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to entire cities to big distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller neighborhoods or big centers, to medium distribution pipelines and lastly to little service pipelines. Each phase in the supply of water and distribution system has to deal with differing flow rates, flow velocities and pressure heads, in addition to different levels of exposure to prospective backwash or impurity infiltration and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to company? The timing of regeneration depends upon the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, despite whether the water in fact requires it. More recent units use electronic sensing units that monitor bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water use and for that reason just regenerate when required. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
