<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
