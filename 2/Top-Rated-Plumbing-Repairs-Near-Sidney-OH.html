<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Home redesigning or house restorations are the perfect time to replace your home's pipes. However, if your home is built on a raised structure then changing the pipes can also be done with minimal damage. Residences constructed on a slab foundation can gain from having their pipes changed though the quantity of drywall patching and painting is generally greater.</p>
<p>Water on the Floor or Discoloration of Floor covering - If your feet get wet when you flush, that's not a function ... it's a problem! It could imply a leak under the toilet if your linoleum floor is getting dark around the toilet. Tough water is normally not hazardous to one's health however can posture serious plumbing problems in both commercial and residential applications. From the lack of suds formation in bathing and laundry applications to the expensive breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers and other devices that manage water, water hardness is a serious concern.</p>
