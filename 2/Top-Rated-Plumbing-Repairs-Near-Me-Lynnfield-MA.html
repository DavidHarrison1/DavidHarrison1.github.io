<p>The key to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Lynnfield MA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
