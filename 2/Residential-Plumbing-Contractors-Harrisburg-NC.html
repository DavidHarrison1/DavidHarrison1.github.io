This can take place in several locations and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your home.</p>
