<h3>Floor Drain Cleaning in LongBeach Mississippi</h2>
<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber LongBeach MS</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged salt ions.
