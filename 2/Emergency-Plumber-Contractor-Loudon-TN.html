<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system. Typically, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can find and identify the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
