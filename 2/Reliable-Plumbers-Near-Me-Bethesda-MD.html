<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Bethesda MD</h3>
<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action crew is available for initial investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets. City employees will check and get rid of obstructions in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for. You might have to wait till the storm has actually decreased to have actually the backup dealt with if the issue is the result of too much storm water in the system.</p>
