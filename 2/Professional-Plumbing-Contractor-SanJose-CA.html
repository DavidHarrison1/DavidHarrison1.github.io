<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
