<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - mainly with sinks. For the most part, a sink drain issue is caused by extreme impurities or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps.

Anytime you find a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to diagnose the problem and advise the best repairs.</p>
