Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does happen more frequently than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, often it takes place at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
