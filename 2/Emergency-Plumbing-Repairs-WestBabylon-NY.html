I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
