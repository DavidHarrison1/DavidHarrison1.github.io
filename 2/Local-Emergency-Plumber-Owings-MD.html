<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if required, changed.
