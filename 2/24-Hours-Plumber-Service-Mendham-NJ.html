<p>Poorly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy task. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>A lot of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
