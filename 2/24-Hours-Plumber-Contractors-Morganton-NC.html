<p>Root Intrusion: Root intrusion describes what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause clogs, breaks, and back-ups which may result in substantial home damage.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
