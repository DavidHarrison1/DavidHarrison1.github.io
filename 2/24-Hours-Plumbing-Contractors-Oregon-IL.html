For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
