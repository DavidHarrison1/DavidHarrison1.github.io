<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
