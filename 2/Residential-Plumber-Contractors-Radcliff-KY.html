<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper precautions if using one of these items.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are an important function in any modern kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink may not have one, forcing you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain.

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
