<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
