<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never wish to see this company again.</p>
