<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
