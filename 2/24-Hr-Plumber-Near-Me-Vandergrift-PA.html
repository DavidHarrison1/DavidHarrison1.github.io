<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I find that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no hint on what they are saying. Due to the fact that they don't like the innovation and not due to the fact that it does not work, will also state something does not work well simply. If this heater is set up in a home with numerous restrooms, the piping procedure adds to the installation costs.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected utilizing the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe should be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is in fact a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, pierced or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
