Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller sized model that ran on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
