<p>When choosing the proper system security there are numerous factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are created to match the threat that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to satisfy that particular risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary considerably.</p>
