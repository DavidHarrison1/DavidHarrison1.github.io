The particles of calcium integrate, become much heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment procedure.

Throughout regeneration, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
