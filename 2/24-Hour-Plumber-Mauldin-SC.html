<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem.

Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
