<h3>When To Call A Plumber FallRiver MA</h3>
<p>Tankless water heaters are also fueled by gas or electricity, but they do not store water within the system. They are compact and just heat water as required, making them more eco-friendly. Tankless water heaters generally require a higher initial investment, however they are less expensive to operate and offer additional benefits like unlimited warm water.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were really responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome job. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when hot water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.

The majority of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

As the outer coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
