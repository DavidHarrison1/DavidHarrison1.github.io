<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
