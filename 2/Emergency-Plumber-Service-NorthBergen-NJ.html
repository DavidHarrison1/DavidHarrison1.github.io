<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future.
