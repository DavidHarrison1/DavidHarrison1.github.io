<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
