<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house.
