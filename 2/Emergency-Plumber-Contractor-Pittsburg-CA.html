An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
