<h3>Clogged Toilet in Wilmington Massachusetts</h2>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
