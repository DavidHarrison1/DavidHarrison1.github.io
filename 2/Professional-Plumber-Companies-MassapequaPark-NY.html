While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that functions as a chelating agent.
