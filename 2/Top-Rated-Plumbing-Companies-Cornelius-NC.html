<p>The majority of cars have a metal line that runs the length of the cars and truck with rubber fuel lines linking at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine. Fixing a leaking fuel line is a simple job for a repair facility and costs between $60 and $120. Lavacot states it can easily be done in the house by the semi-advanced mechanic.

<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
