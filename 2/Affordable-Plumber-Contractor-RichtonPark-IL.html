<p>The next step we need to carry out in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
