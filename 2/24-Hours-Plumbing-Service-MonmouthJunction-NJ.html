<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the exterior if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will occasionally release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit sufficient drainage.</p>
