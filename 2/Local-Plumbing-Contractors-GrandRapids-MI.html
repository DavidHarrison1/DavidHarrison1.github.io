Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these concerns.</p>
