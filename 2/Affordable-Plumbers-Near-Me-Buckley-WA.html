<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the residential or commercial property or condo board. Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit strategies with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not gotten accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent out. Violators will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to civil and criminal proceedings and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
