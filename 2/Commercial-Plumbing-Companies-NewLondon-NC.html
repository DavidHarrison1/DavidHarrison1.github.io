<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in NewLondon NC!</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Sound is regular, however when you observe that the sounds are all there however food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has gone. Some sounds indicate the need for repairs or a good clean out, and you can provide the system a great check prior to beginning to price new ones. But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you money for really little future use.</p>
