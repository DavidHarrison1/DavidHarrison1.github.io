<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Olney MD</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
