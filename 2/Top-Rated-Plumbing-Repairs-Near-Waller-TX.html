<p>Sometimes, our service technicians will suggest that you replace your water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is usually the case when the water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would amount to over half the cost of an entire brand-new unit.

When this takes place, we suggest that you employ one of our professional plumbers to help you unclog your toilet.</p>
