<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your home.</p>
