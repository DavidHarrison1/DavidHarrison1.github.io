<p>Waste disposal unit guarantees last an average of 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and ten years. Given that the typical life-span of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you might wish to purchase an extended service warranty.

<p>The system has gone back to a no need condition (no valves open downstream).
