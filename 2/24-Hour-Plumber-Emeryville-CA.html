<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Emeryville CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
