<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be dealt with right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
