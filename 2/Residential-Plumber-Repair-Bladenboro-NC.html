<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the exterior if either check valve should leak. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now because of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
