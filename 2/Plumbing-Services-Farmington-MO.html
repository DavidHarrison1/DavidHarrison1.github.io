<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the diminished salt water solution after the regrowth cycle. Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses should have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the devoted drain. An air gap might be used to achieve this, and might be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
