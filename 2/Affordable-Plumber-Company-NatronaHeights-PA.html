<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the splendor in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge between guy and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to wiggle and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all severity however, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those small daily inconveniences - that the majority of people just live with and never understand they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water lost every day by a bad seal.</p>
