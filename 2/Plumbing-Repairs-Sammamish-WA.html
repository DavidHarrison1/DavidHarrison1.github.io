<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
