<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
