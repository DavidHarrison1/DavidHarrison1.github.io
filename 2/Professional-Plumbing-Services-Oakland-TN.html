"Regrowing" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or complete. However, lots of water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium actually isn't full. This can be remedied by simply resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>
