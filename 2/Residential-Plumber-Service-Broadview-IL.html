Every house needs to have carbon monoxide detectors set up at the proper places. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are typically offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
