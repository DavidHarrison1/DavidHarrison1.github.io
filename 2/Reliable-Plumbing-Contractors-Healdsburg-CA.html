When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
