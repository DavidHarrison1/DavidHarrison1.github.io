<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Hanover PA</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

This consists of not just the plumbing in the kitchen or bathroom that you're remaking, however also any pipes travelling through the walls to feed upstairs restrooms.</p>
