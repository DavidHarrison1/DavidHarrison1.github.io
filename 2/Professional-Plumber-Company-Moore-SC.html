<p>Gas lines featured outer covers that are mostly made of plastic. Eliminate them to expose the gas pipes underneath. Put on a gas mask since inhaling such gases is dangerous for your respiratory system. Make sure to use gloves too. Electric water heaters also heat water inside a storage tank for distribution throughout your house. In this case, two electric heating components controlled by specific thermostats are accountable for heating the water inside the tank.</p>
<p>Your disposer may feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket might lead to small amounts of water gathering around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
