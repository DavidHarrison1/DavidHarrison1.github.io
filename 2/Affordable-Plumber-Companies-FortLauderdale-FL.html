<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in FortLauderdale Florida</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
