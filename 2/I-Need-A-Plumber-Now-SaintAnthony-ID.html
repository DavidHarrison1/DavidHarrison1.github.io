<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
