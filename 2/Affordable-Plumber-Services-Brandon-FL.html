<p>We truly care about our consumers and the services that we offer. As tough water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, totally free" sodium ions are launched into the water.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
