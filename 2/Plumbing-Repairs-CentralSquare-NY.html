<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Both will develop an excellent seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
