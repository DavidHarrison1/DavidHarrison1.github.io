<p>Borax sits in the exact same household of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it includes the same downsides i.e. skin inflammation and build-up. If either of these downsides are inappropriate to you - you'll want to find what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Switch on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and move the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. listed below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>

That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>
