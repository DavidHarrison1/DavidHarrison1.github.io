<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were timely and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an incredible task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
