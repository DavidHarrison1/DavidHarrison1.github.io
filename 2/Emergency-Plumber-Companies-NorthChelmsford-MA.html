<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
