<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Apalachin NY</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers must be tested every year and after repair, relocation, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT).
