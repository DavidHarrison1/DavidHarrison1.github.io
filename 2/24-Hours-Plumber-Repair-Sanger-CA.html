<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
