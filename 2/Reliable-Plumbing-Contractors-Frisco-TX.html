No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Frequently it takes place in the evening when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding areas.</p>
