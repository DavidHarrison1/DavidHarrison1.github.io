<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pressed versus it will lead to decapitation, it might scare a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
<p>The system has gone back to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This enables pressure to match between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
