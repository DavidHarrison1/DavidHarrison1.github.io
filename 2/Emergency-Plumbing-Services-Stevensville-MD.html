<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
