<p>Repiping is not a momentary fix. It's a long-term service for the whole plumbing system in your home or company. We turn off the water supply, get rid of old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the brand-new system is set up, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system.
