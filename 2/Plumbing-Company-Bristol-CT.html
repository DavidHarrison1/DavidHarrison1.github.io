<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, consisting of bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and deterioration.

<p>In municipal water supply systems, water is normally preserved at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing components in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique made use of.

The appropriate backflow prevention device is needed if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
