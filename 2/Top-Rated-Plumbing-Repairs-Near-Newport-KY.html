Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

<p>The majority of plumbers will remove the old system to install the brand-new one at the same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new unit, therefore increasing expenses. This actually depends on what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how hard the old unit is to eliminate. Oftentimes, elimination will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, however in many cases the expenses might be greater if additional pipes should also be replaced.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's an irreversible service for the entire plumbing system in your home or company. We turn off the water system, eliminate old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system. When the system passes our tests, it's great to go for you.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
