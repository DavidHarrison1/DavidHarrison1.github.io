<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Adairsville GA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>All devices or systems supplied by safe and clean water lines that may go through contamination should have airgaps (Ct. Regs. § 19-13-38a( b )).
