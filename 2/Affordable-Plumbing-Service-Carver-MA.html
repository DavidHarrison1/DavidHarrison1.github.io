<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control.
