Prolonged guarantee: Many disposals come with at least a 1-year service warranty, but if you buy one with a life time warranty (15+ years), it will probably be more pricey.

<p>The cost associated with sewer line inspection might differ substantially based on your scenarios. Homeowners can normally expect a price point between $100 and $300, however of course, this is just a rough estimate.

You must also know all the services that include your sewer video inspection. The cost may consist of additional services, justifying a higher rate.</p>
