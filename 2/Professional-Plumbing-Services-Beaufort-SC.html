<p>Other than water dripping and the periodic creak, your pipes need to not be making any odd sounds, specifically not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a proven sign of a bigger problem. Have your pipes inspected as soon as possible so you do not end up with a significant leak.</p>
