<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined quirks in how my sink was assembled. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will suit the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free.

If the leak isn't spotted quickly, obviously it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage.</p>
