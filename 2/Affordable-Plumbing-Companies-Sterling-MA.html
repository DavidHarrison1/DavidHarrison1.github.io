<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
