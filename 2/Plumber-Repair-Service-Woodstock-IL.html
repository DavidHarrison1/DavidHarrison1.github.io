For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable kind of rust control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
