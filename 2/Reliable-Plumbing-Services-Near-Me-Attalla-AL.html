<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical flow instructions within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
