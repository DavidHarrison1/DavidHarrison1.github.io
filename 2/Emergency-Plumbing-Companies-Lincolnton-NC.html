<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Lincolnton NC</h3>
<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous factors that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up corrosion Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control. Thus, considering all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
