<p>Hidden water leakages are typically difficult and have Possibly Major Effects. Changing your flapper may require somewhat various steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3).

To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
