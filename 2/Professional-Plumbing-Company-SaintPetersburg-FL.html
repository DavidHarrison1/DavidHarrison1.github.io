<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
