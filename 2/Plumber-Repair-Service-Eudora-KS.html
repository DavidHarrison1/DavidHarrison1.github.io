Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. The time between charging cycles depends upon the solidity of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to remove hardness.</p>
