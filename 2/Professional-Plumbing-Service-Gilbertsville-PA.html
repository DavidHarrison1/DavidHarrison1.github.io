<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
