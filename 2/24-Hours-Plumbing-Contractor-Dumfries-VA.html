<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>Backflow threatens because it can pollute the public drinking supply with impurities like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky primary school suffered nausea and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will test your water to determine the right water treatment for your home. A single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area due to the fact that the softener's brine tank nests inside of the salt tank.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
