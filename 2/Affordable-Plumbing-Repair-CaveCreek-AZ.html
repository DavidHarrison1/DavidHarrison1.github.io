<p>Visible smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or service area, give us a call. That smell might be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair work right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will typically need to be replaced instead of repaired. You'll understand this if your pipes are gurgling or releasing foul odors.</p>

Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
