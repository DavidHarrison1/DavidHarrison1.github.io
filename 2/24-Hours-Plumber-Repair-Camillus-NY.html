<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller sized design that operated on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>

Suggestion: Throw a towel on the floor underneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
