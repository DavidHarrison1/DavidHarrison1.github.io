<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water solution after the regrowth cycle. Secure the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses need to have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap may be used to achieve this, and might be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>

<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services BaySaintLouis MS</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular event, but it does occur more often than you believe! Frequently it takes place at night when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
