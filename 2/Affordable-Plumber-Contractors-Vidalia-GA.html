<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
