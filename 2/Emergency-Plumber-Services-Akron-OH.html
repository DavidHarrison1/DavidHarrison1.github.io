<p>Inspections avoid a high portion of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run appropriately. It is very important to guarantee there is always two feet of clearance around it. You should also drain about 25 percent of your tank regularly (a few times each year). This will help eliminate any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts routine re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in difficult water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes good.</p>
