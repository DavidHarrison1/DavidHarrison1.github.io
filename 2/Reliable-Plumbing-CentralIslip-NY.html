I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work.
