It's why many cleaning products today consist of chelating agents or other forms of water softeners.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>

The majority of waste disposal unit will last roughly 10 to 12 years, so their purchase cost should be thought about as a financial investment for this time. Lime softening increases the pH of the water, which develops an unwelcoming environment for disease-causing bacteria. This is the first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Division's multi-barrier disinfection process.</p>
