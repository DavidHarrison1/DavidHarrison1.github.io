<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
