<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Syosset NY</h3>
<p>While not every state requires insurance before contractor licenses are released, having your own assurances the security of your business. Unpredicted occasions and undesirable scenarios might happen anytime and being unprepared can put your business in huge financial trouble. To be safe rather than sorry, getting the right insurance coverage for your plumbing company works as a defense against financial risks and organisation jeopardies.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
