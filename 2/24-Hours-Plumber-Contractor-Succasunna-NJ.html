<p>You live in an older home. There's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
