<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
