Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
