<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
