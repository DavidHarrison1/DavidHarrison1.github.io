<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller model that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes.
