<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if relevant). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in.

Not that I would understand from experience.</p>

It's important to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to an issue, the much better opportunity you'll need to save money and time on water heater services.</p>
