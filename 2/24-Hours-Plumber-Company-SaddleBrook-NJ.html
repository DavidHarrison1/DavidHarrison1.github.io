The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All brand-new replacement pipes have a projected life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe removal.
