If new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping, a strategy might be needed to get the license.</p>
<p>The repair service technician need to have the ability to identify the lots of different manufacturers and the specific designs produced throughout the years. Some models might appear similar on the outside but might require various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician must be able to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. In some cases the serial number of the assembly will be required to distinguish one model from another. It is very important to understand the correct design to guarantee you get the proper repair parts.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
