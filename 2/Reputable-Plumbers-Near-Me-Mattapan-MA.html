After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely methods your toilet has a leak. This concern is frequently brought on by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as easy as a worn flapper valve.</p>
<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up effectively, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>
