<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust.
