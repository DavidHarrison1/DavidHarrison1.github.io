<p>In the tubs, showers, and sinks in your home, the obstructions happen due to the fact that hair and soap collect in the drains. Is your water heater draining properly? Our plumbers know the right methods to clear the drains from these issues. There is no chance to take a shower when the water will not drain from the shower tray. We will have your drains cleared rapidly, so you can as soon as again take a shower.</p>
<p>Electric water heaters do have a few drawbacks however that deserve mentioning. Most importantly, electricity is not as cheap as gas. Some utility companies charge higher rates for electricity during peak periods such as really early in the morning and in the evening. Utilizing your heater during these peak durations can increase your power expenses. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a fixed rate. Another drawback of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be expensive to install, particularly when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
