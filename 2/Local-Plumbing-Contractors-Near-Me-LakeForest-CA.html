<p>The average life expectancy of an electrical hot water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, little pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a larger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house.</p>
<p>While some of these products seem harmless enough, they can all add to damaging the grinding system or obstructing and jamming the disposal. It is an excellent concept always to utilize cold water when running the garbage disposal, and you can use orange or lemon skins to help clean and refresh the drain. At A&A Plumbing, our techs are specialists with garbage disposals and can diagnose and repair your problem with ease.</p>
