<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
