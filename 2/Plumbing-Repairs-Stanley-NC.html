A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private residences, it likewise prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and contaminating the public water system.</p>

If you live in a structure that is around 50 years old, there is a likelihood that your pipes were made with galvanized metal which is most likely to burst as it ages. Once your home starts to approach this age, you should start getting more regular inspections and maintenance examine your plumbing to ensure you don't have any leakages or damage developing in your house.</p>

<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are set up in locations where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
