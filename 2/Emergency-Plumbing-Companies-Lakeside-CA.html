<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>

This truly depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how difficult the old unit is to get rid of. In most cases, removal will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in many cases the costs could be greater if extra pipes should likewise be replaced.</p>
