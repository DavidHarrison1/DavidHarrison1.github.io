<h3>Water Softener Repair in Covington Louisiana</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
