<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for effectiveness, along with examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
