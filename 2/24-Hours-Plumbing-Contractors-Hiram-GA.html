<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
