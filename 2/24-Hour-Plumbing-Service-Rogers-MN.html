<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a chance to become layered inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are especially susceptible to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a duration of three to five months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Numerous new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
