To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
