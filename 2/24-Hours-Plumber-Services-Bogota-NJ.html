<p>It's an excellent idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a few times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can locate and identify the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>

This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
