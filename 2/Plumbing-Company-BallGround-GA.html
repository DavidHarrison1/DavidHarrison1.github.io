The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a predetermined level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
