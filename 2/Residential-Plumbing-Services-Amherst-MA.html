Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>As soon as the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
