Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
