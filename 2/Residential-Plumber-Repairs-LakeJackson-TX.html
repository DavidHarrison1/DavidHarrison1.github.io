<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does occur more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a few minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
