<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in JacksonHeights NY</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall.

We have total confidence that we can handle any type of repair you toss at us.</p>
