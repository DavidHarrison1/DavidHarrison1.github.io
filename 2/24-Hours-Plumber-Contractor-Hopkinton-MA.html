<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Hopkinton MA</h3>
<p>IRWD is committed to delivering safe, high quality water to customers. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of harmful impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>So what should you do as a homeowner? To start with, do not attempt to tackle the task of fixing the sink yourself.
