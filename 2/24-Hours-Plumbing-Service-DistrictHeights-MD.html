<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and extremely responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>

<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never ever takes place.</p>
