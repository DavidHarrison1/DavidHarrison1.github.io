<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal launch while your head is pushed against it will lead to decapitation, it might frighten a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
<p>Press the suggestion of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap till you break loose the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the system upside down and shake it out).

At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
