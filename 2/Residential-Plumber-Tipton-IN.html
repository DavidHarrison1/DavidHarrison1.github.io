<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the local system, it's still wise to generate the professionals to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take obligation if it leaked now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, given that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
<p>5. Put warm water down your drain after using the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, rinse your drain with a bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never ever a pleasant experience. Fortunately, you do not always need the support of a professional to fix it.</p>
