<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in different parts of the plumbing system, most typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns and even stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next common issue that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which takes place when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it reduces the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming an issue in your water system by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>
