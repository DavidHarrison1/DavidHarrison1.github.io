<p>When the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
