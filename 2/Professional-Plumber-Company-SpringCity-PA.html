Even if you do not need a new hot water heater right now, chances are you will within the next few years. Water heaters tend to last 7 to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this short article is also for you. Replacing a water heater isn't challenging if you come in handy with fundamental tools and have a little experience soldering copper.</p>
