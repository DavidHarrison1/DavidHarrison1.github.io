When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house.

Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
